      <h1>Solar System Rhythms</h1>
      <!-- <p>
        Think of a day in space as the time it takes for a planet to complete
        one full spin. On Earth, this spin gives us our familiar cycle of day
        and night. But out there, each planet dances to its own rhythm. Some
        whirl around so quickly that their days zip by in just a few hours,
        while others take months to finish one spin, making their days feel like
        epic adventures.

    <div class="planet-info" id="Mercury-info">
      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your parents trying to wake you up for school as the sun rises,
        but instead of begging for "5 more minutes," you can ask for "5 more
        days!" On Mercury, one day is like waiting through almost three entire
        school years for just one morning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Venus-info">
      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Picture this: While Earth has 365 days in a year, Venus has just one!
        That's because Venus takes about 230 Earth days to spin once and the
        same time to orbit the Sun. It's like living in a world where you only
        get one sunrise and one sunset during your entire trip around the Sun -
        talk about a long day!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Earth-info">
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Home sweet home! Here, a day is a perfect 24 hoursâ€”just the right amount
        of time to hang out with friends, go to school, and catch your favorite
        TV show. It's the ideal rhythm for life, balancing work and play
        seamlessly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Mars-info">
      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Think of your day as a slightly longer school day, lasting 24.6 hours.
        On Mars, mornings and nights stretch just a bit more, giving you a
        little extra time to explore or relax. It's like having an extra five
        minutes in your day to finish that last homework assignment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Jupiter-info">
      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your day being a whirlwind, lasting only about 10 Earth hours!
        On Jupiter, everything happens almost twice as fast - your math class
        only takes 30 minutes, dinner is over in 15, and even your annoying
        sibling bugs you for half the usual time! It's like someone nudged the
        playback speed to x2 on life.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Saturn-info">
      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn's day is a speedy 10.7 hours, similar to Jupiter's but just a tad
        longer. It's like living in a place where time flies, and you might feel
        like you're always on the go.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Uranus-info">
      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your day being a breezy 17 Earth hours - that's about 7 hours
        less sunlight than we get on Earth! On Uranus, time feels a bit
        different, like having shorter afternoons for hanging out with friends
        or enjoying video game sessions. You'd need to pack your outdoor
        activities into less daylight time, but the shorter day means you won't
        get too tired before bedtime.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Neptune-info">
      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune offers a 16-hour day, which is shorter than Earth's but still
        gives you plenty of daylight. It's like having a condensed day where you
        can pack in your favorite activities without feeling rushed.
