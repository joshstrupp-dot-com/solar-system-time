      <h1>Solar System Rhythms</h1>
      <!-- <p>
        Think of a day in space as the time it takes for a planet to complete
        one full spin. On Earth, this spin gives us our familiar cycle of day
        and night. But out there, each planet dances to its own rhythm. Some
        whirl around so quickly that their days zip by in just a few hours,
        while others take months to finish one spin, making their days feel like
        epic adventures.

    <div class="planet-info" id="Mercury-info">
      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine waking up and watching the sunrise, but it takes 88 Earth days!
        On Mercury, one day is like waiting through almost three entire school
        years for just one morning. It's as if your weekends were stretched out
        for months. Every sunrise feels like a grand event because it doesn't
        happen often!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Venus-info">
      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Picture this: You press the snooze button, but each snooze adds 243
        Earth days to your sleep. On Venus, a single day is longer than almost
        its entire trip around the Sun! It's like living in a world where
        mornings take forever to arrive, making each day feel like a slow,
        endless movie.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Earth-info">
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Home sweet home! Here, a day is a perfect 24 hoursâ€”just the right amount
        of time to hang out with friends, go to school, and catch your favorite
        TV show. It's the ideal rhythm for life, balancing work and play
        seamlessly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Mars-info">
      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Think of your day as a slightly longer school day, lasting 24.6 hours.
        On Mars, mornings and nights stretch just a bit more, giving you a
        little extra time to explore or relax. It's like having an extra five
        minutes in your day to finish that last homework assignment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Jupiter-info">
      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your day being a whirlwind, lasting only about 10 Earth hours!
        On Jupiter, the day zooms by faster than a roller coaster ride. It's
        like having several mini-days packed into one, where you can watch
        multiple sunrises and sunsets in what feels like a single Earth day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Saturn-info">
      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn's day is a speedy 10.7 hours, similar to Jupiter's but just a tad
        longer. It's like living in a place where time flies, and you might feel
        like you're always on the go. Each day is a quick sprint, giving you
        bursts of activity before the next sunrise.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Uranus-info">
      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine your day being a breezy 17 Earth hours. On Uranus, time feels a
        bit stretched, like a long afternoon hanging out with friends or
        enjoying an extended video game session. It's enough time to do a lot,
        but not so long that it feels exhausting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="planet-info" id="Neptune-info">
      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune offers a 16-hour day, which is shorter than Earth's but still
        gives you plenty of daylight. It's like having a condensed day where you
        can pack in your favorite activities without feeling rushed. Think of it
        as a power-packed day full of energy and excitement.
